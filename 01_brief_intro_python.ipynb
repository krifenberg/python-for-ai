    "In this module, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language. While Python is a full language with lots of functionality, the reality is that to **do** AI, you need relatively little code. With the basics covered in these modules, you should be set to get started. We will add additional Python sections to introduce more information later, but this should get you well on your way!\n",
    "\n",
    "### After this module, students will be able to:\n",
    "* Define what a variable is and how the basic Python operators work.\n",
    "* Recognize the importance of a consistent coding style and clear documentation.\n",
    "* Analyze Python error messages and identify corrective action to fix them.\n",
    "* Describe the various Python data types and be able to typecast a variable.\n",
    "* Discuss the importance of reusability and how libraries implement this concept.\n",
    "* Use import statements to access library functions.\n",
    "* Write clearly documented single-purpose functions.\n",
    "* Develop a personal coding style which reflects coding best practices."

    "### Before we start, a few important tips:\n",
    "1. This file is a **Jupyter notebook**. It combines `text cells` and `code cells` and is useful as a hybrid didactic/experiential learning environment. In practice, Jupyter notebooks are often used for rapid code prototyping or communicating code and results in an understandable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter notebooks are *interactive*, and any code inside a code block is **executable**! Users will see the results of running code blocks directly inside the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are 2 ways to execute a code cell:\n",
    "    1. Select (click) the cell, and click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button at the top o the notebook (or to the left of the cell in Google Colab) to execute the code.\n",
    "    2. Select the cell, and press `Control + Enter` (on Mac, `Command + Enter`)\n",
